This project helps a user skip navigating through Youtube to find a video/song they'd like to view/hear, 
and to instead be directed to a youtube link of the song they would like, when they either type in a number from the list of songs printed to the screen or type the name of the song/video of their choice.
"Feature" 1: List of songs with corresponding numbers
"Feature" 2: Option to enter song outside of those listed
The user can type p to keep "playing" or s to stop the program.
